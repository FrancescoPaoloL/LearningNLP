Rizz is an Internet slang word defined as "style, charm, or attractiveness; the ability to attract a romantic or sexual partner".[1] The phrase was coined by YouTuber Kai Cenat in mid-2021. Short for "charisma" (or, possibly, romantic charisma), it subsequently garnered virality on the social media application TikTok. It was named Oxford University Press' word of the year for 2023.Etymology: YouTuber Kai Cenat, who coined the word "rizz". The origin of the word in mid-2021 is attributed to Kai Cenat. Streaming on Twitch, Cenat would share to people how to have "rizz" and developed other phrases, such as "W rizz" and "L rizz", to describe a person's "winning" or "losing" abilities at attracting or chatting up a person. "Rizz" is a colloquial noun, used when describing possessing it. As a verb, "rizz" can be used to describe using "rizz" to attract someone, as to "rizz up" a person. It is believed that the middle part of the word "charisma" was shortened to create the word "rizz". The Oxford University Press described this formation pattern for a word as "unusual". However, this formation pattern can be seen in the shortening of words such as "refrigerator" (to "fridge"), and "influenza" (to "flu"). The word is mainly used by Generation Z (people born in the late 1990s to mid 2000s).[5] Further development of the word "rizz" includes "unspoken rizz", referring to a persons ability to attract a person without speaking, such as by simply glancing over at them. In the media Cenat stated in a June 2022 interview on the music podcast No Jumper that after the word went viral on TikTok, he stopped using it himself, stating that the viral use on TikTok "butchered" the word. "Rizz" went further viral in June 2023, after actor Tom Holland explained in an interview with BuzzFeed that he possessed "limited rizz" and it was by playing the "long game" that helped to win over his now-girlfriend, actor Zendaya. From this, a number of memes were created.
